# LAKME

This repository includes the manually corrected linguistic annotation of Mishnaic treatises created in the PSL-project LAKME in 2017-2018.
The LAKME project covered also the annotation of Middle French with Jean-Baptiste CAMPS (ENC). On the NLP side it was headed by Thierry POIBEAU (CNRS, ENS, LATTICE).
Collaborators for the Hebrew material: Daniel STOEKL BEN EZRA (EPHE, PI), Hayim LAPIN (co-PI) Avigail OHALI (EPHE, today Paris 3), Pawel JABLONSKI (EPHE).
The annotation was first created automatically with the morphological tagger by Meni ADLER (U Beersheva and DICTA) and then manually corrected with an ergonomic tool  by Shealtiel SHMIDMAN (DICTA) and Avi SHMIDMAN (Bar Ilan University and DICTA).
The code in the ref column gives order (seder from 1-6), treatise (masskhet in the canonical order), chapter, halakha, word.

We corrected the following Mishnaic treatises:
- Bikkurim (ref 1.11).
- Shabbat 1 (ref 2.1.1).
- Yoma (ref 2.5)
- Megillah (ref 2.10)
- Kiddushin (ref 3.7)
- Baba Qamma (ref 4.1)
- Baba Metsia (ref 4.2)
- Baba Batra (ref 4.3)
- Avot (ref 4.9)
- Zevahot 1 (ref 5.1)
- Middot 1-2 (ref 5.10)
- Kelim 1-2 (ref 6.1)
